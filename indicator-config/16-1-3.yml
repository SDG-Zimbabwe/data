  <p><strong>Definition:</strong></p>

  <p>The total number of persons who have been victim of (a) physical, (b)
  psychological and (c) sexual violence in the previous 12 months, as a share of
  the total population.</p>

  <p>Three separate indicators should be computed, one for each type of
  violence.</p>

  <p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p>

  <p>This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from (a) physical,
  (b) psychological and (c) sexual violence respectively.</p>

  <p><strong>(a) Physical violence:</strong> This concept largely corresponds to
  physical assault and robbery.</p>

  <p>Assault is defined in the International Classification of Crime for
  Statistical Purposes (ICCS) as: the intentional or reckless application of
  physical force inflicted upon the body of a person.<sup><a href="#footnote-2"
  id="footnote-ref-2">[1]</a></sup> This includes the intentional or reckless
  application of serious physical force resulting in serious bodily injury, and
  the intentional or reckless application of minor physical force resulting in
  no injury or minor bodily injury. According to the ICCS, these are defined
  as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Serious bodily injury, at minimum, includes gunshot or bullet wounds; knife or stab wounds; severed limbs; broken bones or teeth knocked out; internal injuries; being knocked unconscious; and other severe or critical injuries.</li>
    <li>Serious physical force, at minimum, includes being shot; stabbed or cut; hit by an object; hit by a thrown object; poisoning and other applications of force with the potential to cause serious bodily injury.</li>
    <li>Minor bodily injury, at minimum, includes bruises, cuts, scratches, chipped teeth, swelling, black eye and other minor injuries.</li>
    <li>Minor physical force, at minimum, includes hitting, slapping, pushing, tripping, knocking down and other applications of force with the potential to cause minor bodily injury.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In addition to acts of assault, acts amounting to serious physical threats
  are also included in the definition of physical violence. As defined in the
  ICCS, serious physical threats refer to threats with the intention to cause
  death or serious bodily injury.<sup><a href="#footnote-3"
  id="footnote-ref-3">[2]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Furthermore, physical violence also covers acts of robbery, defined in the
  ICCS as unlawfully taking or obtaining property with the use of force or
  threat of force against a person with intent to permanently or temporarily
  withhold it from a person or organization.<sup><a href="#footnote-4"
  id="footnote-ref-4">[3]</a></sup></p>

  <p>Physical violence only counts as such when it is non-consensual, for
  example, acts of physical violence (punching, kicking, etc.) experienced while
  exercising a regulated combat sport or combat training will not count towards
  victimization prevalence.</p>

  <p>In the absence of suitable data on physical violence, it is possible to use
  data on physical assault or robbery, given they are both component of physical
  violence. </p>

  <p><strong>Psychological violence:</strong> There is no consensus at the
  international level on the precise definition of psychological violence.
  Psychological violence may be defined as any intentional and reckless act that
  causes psychological distress to an individual. Psychological violence can
  take the form of, for example, coercion, defamation, humiliation,
  intimidation, credible threats of violence, excessive verbal attacks or
  bullying, or harassment. Often, psychological violence is a pattern of
  behaviours, but it may be a distinct incident as well. Psychological violence
  is often experienced in domestic contexts. The internationally standardized
  and tested SDG 16 survey questionnaire provides a methodology and a core set
  of questions to measure psychological violence (see Section 4.c. Method of
  computation). </p>

  <p><strong>Sexual violence</strong>: As defined in the International
  Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), sexual violence
  includes unwanted sexual acts or attempts to obtain a sexual act without valid
  consent or with consent as a result of intimidation, force, fraud, coercion,
  threat, deception, use of drugs or alcohol, or abuse of power or of a position
  of vulnerability. This includes rape and other forms of sexual assault,
  excluding non-physical sexual assault (e.g. sexual harassment). Sexual
  violence may be perpetrated by casual partners, by acquaintances or by
  strangers, but such acts also occur in established or even in formalized
  intimate partnerships, including in marriages. Sexual violence most often, but
  not exclusively, targets women. Sexual violence may also take place in
  same-sex contexts.</p>

  <p>More details on the set of behaviours to be used to measure physical,
  psychological and sexual violence are provided in Section 4.c. Method of
  computation.</p><div class="footnotes"><div><sup class="footnote-number"

  href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/statistics/iccs.html">International
  Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes</a> (ICCS)</p>
SOURCE_TYPE__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>Acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, so this
  indicator should be derived from population surveys, not administrative data
  sources.</p>

  <p>Experience of violent victimization is collected through a series of
  questions on concrete acts of violence suffered by the respondent (see Section
  4.c. Method of computation)</p>

  <p>These questions can be part of an add-on module on physical, psychological
  and sexual violence, to be incorporated into other ongoing general population
  surveys (such as surveys on quality of life, public attitudes, or surveys on
  other topics) or be part of dedicated surveys on crime victimization.</p>

  <p>Data should be collected as part of a nationally representative sample of
  the adult population residing in the country, irrespective of legal residence
  status. The sampling frame and sample design should ensure that results can be
  disaggregated at sub-national level. The sample size should be sufficiently
  large to capture relevant events and compute needed disaggregations.</p>
COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>At international level, data on physical, psychological and sexual violence
  are routinely collected by UNODC through the annual UN Survey of Crime Trends
  and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) data collection. As
  requested by the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, over
  140 Member States have already appointed a UN-CTS national focal point that
  delivers UN-CTS data to UNODC. In most cases these focal points are national
  institutions responsible for data production in the area of crime and criminal
  justice (National Statistical Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of
  Justice, etc.). For countries that have not appointed a focal point, the
  request for data is sent to permanent missions in Vienna. When a country does
  not report to UNODC, other official sources such as authoritative websites,
  publications, or other forms of communication are used. Once consolidated,
  data are shared with countries to check their accuracy and validity.</p>

  <p>The UN-CTS provides specific definitions of data to be collected in line
  with the International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes
  (ICCS). It also collects a set of metadata to identify possible discrepancies
  from standard definitions and to assess overall data quality (e.g. sample
  size, target population, agency responsible for the data collection,
  etc.).</p>
FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>Countries are encouraged to conduct surveys on crime victimisation in
  regular intervals, but at least every four years to reflect progress between
  each of the quadrennial reviews of Goal 16 at the High Level Political Forum
  (HLPF).</p>

  <p>UNODC collects data on this indicator according to the following
  schedule:</p>

  <p>III-IV quarter year n</p>
REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>Data on relevant SDG indicators are collected, compiled and sent back to
  countries for data review annually. Data are then reported to UN Statistics
  Division (UNSD) through the regular reporting channels annually.</p>

  <p>II quarter year n+1 (data for year n-1). For instance, data for the year
  2023 are collected in III-IV quarter 2024 and released in II quarter 2025.</p>
DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>Data are collected through official nationally representative surveys. In
  most countries and most cases, such surveys are conducted by National
  Statistical Offices (NSOs). In some cases, other national institutions or
  other entities may conduct surveys on crime victimisation according to the
  same methodological standards.</p>

  <p>Data are sent to UNODC by Member States, usually through national UN Survey
  of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS) Focal
  Points, which in most cases are national institutions responsible for data
  production in the area of crime and criminal justice (National Statistical
  Offices, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Justice, etc.).</p>
COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL: <p>United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)</p>
INST_MANDATE__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) &#x2013; as custodian
  of the UN standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, UNODC
  assists Member States in reforming their criminal justice systems in order to
  be effective, fair and humane for the entire population. UNODC develops
  technical tools to assist Member States in implementing the UN standards and
  norms and supports Member States through the provision of technical assistance
  in crime prevention and criminal justice reform. It does so through several
  Global programmes and through the UNODC field office network.</p>

  <p>UNODC is responsible for carrying out the United Nations Survey of Crime
  Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems (UN-CTS), which was
  introduced through the General Assembly Resolution <a
  href="https://undocs.org/en/A/RES/3021(XXVII)">A/RES/3021(XXVII)</a> in 1972.
  The Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1984/48 of 25 May 1984,
  further requested that the Secretary-General maintain and develop the United
  Nations crime-related database by continuing to conduct surveys of crime
  trends and the operations of criminal justice systems. </p>
RATIONALE__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>This indicator measures the prevalence of victimization from physical,
  psychological, and sexual violence. It is globally relevant as violence in
  various forms occurs in all regions and countries of the world. Given that
  acts of violence are heavily underreported to the authorities, this indicator
  needs to be based on data collected through sample surveys of the adult
  population.</p>
REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>Crime victimization surveys are able to capture experience of violence
  suffered by adult population of both sexes; however, due to the complexity of
  collecting information on experiences of violence, it is likely that not all
  experiences of violence are duly covered by these surveys, which aim to cover
  several types of crime experience. Other dedicated surveys on violence usually
  focus on selected population groups (typically women, children or the elderly)
  or specific contexts (domestic violence, schools, prisons, etc.), but they are
  not able to portray levels and trends of violence in the entire
  population.</p>

  <p>Victimization surveys (as dedicated surveys or as modules of household
  surveys) are usually restricted to the general population living in households
  above a certain age (typically 15 or 18 years of age and older), while
  sometimes an upper age limit is also applied (typically 65, 70 or 75 years of
  age).</p>
DATA_COMP__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>The indicator is calculated as the number of survey respondents who have
  been victim of (a) physical, (b) psychological, and(c) sexual violence in the
  previous 12 months, divided by the total number of survey respondents.</p>

  <p>Three separate indicators should be computed, one for each type of
  violence.</p>

  <p>The indicators refer to the individual (&#x201C;direct&#x201D;) experience
  of the respondent, who should be randomly selected among eligible household
  members. Experiences of violence by other members of the household should not
  be included in the computation.</p>

  <p>The internationally standardized and tested <a
  href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/sdgs/SDG16_Survey_Initiative_-_Questionnaire.pdf">SDG
  16 Survey questionnaire</a> and the accompanying <a
  href="https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/sdgs/SDG16_Survey_Initiative_-_Implementation_Manual.pdf">Implementation
  Manual</a>, which can be used by countries for collecting data SDG indicator
  16.1.3, provide a core set of questions about specific behaviours that allow
  for the measurement of the prevalence of physical, sexual and psychological
  violence in the population. The Latin America and the Caribbean Crime
  Victimization Survey Initiative (LACSI) also offers a standardised methodology
  to measure violence. </p>

  <p>While the precise formulation and wording of the pertinent survey questions
  may need national customization, a core set of behaviours have been identified
  as indicative of physical, psychological and sexual violence exercised towards
  a person.</p>

  <p>Questions on physical, psychological and sexual violence are to be measured
  separately. Both numerator and denominator are measured through sample surveys
  of the general population.</p>

  <p>The computation of this indicator requires the inclusion of a short
  module<sup><a href="#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5">[4]</a></sup> in a
  representative population survey, which elicits whether the respondent has, in
  the past 12 months, personally experienced any of the following acts or
  behaviours indicative of physical, psychological and sexual violence (see
  Table 1): </p>

DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>The data for the indicator are collected through household surveys
  conducted by National Statistics Offices (NSOs) or other institutions
  following tight survey protocols and complying with the metadata. Data
  producers are encouraged to strictly follow the data quality practices,
  protocols and frameworks in relation of data quality. In addition to the data,
  countries are requested to report on the metadata which serves as one
  additional layer of validation and verification of the data. For survey-based
  indicators, metadata are assessed in relation to the representativeness and
  coverage of the survey as well as alignment of question wording and answer
  options with international standards.</p>

  <p>Before publication by custodian agencies, a standardised
  &#x201C;pre-publication process&#x201D; is implemented, where national
  stakeholders can verify and review the data before publication. </p>

  <p>In 2022, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) together with
  the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the Office of the United
  Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) published the SDG 16 Survey
  Questionnaire and Implementation Manual, which contain internationally
  standardised survey question wording (in the five official UN languages) as
  well as implementation guidance related to this indicator. The questionnaire
  and manual are available at:</p>

  <p>In 2013, the UNODC through its UNODC-INEGI Center of Excellence in
  Statistical Information on Government, Crime, Victimization and Justice (CoE)
  in Mexico, created the Latin America and the Caribbean Crime Victimization
  Survey Initiative (LACSI), a regionally standardized methodology to measure
  comprehensively victimization, the perception of safety and the performance of
  authorities in a comparable manner in line with United Nations international
  standards. LACSI is led by UNODC, and it is supported by the Inter-American
  Development Bank (IDB), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and
  the Organization of American States (OAS). The Initiative&apos;s Working Group
  (composed by 14 countries of the LAC region) meets periodically to review and
  update the main methodological tool. The meeting minutes, conceptual framework
  and methodological tools are available at: <a
  href="https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/lacsi-initiative/">https://www.cdeunodc.inegi.org.mx/index.php/lacsi-initiative/</a></p>

  <p>In 2010, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the
  United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNODC-UNECE) published a Manual
  on Victimization Surveys that provides technical guidance on the
  implementation of such surveys, on the basis of good practices developed at
  the country-level. The UNODC-UNECE Manual on Victimization Surveys (2010) is
  available at: <a
  href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Manual-on-victim-surveys.html">https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/Manual-on-victim-surveys.html</a>
  </p>
QUALITY_MGMNT__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has a statistical
  section with dedicated staff to support the data collection through technical
  assistance, collating and verifying the received data and continuously improve
  data collection mechanisms including guidelines.</p>
QUALITY_ASSURE__GLOBAL: >-
  <p>It is recommended that National Statistics Offices (NSOs) serve as the main
  contact for compiling and assuring the quality of the necessary data to report
  on SDG 16.1.3, in close coordination with other relevant bodies in the
  country. Automated and substantive validation procedures are in place when
  data are processed by custodian agencies to assess their consistency and
  compliance with standards.</p>
QUALITY_ASSMNT__GLOBAL: <p>See section 4.d. Validation.</p>

  <p><strong>Data availability:</strong></p>

  <p>While several countries, especially in the Americas under the LACSI
  methodology, have implemented national victimization surveys<sup><a
  href="#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8">[7]</a></sup>, at the global level,
  there continues to be limited availability of survey-based data for measuring
  physical, psychological and sexual violence prevalence.</p>

  <p>For this reason, UNODC partnered with UNDP and OHCHR to develop the
  internationally standardized and tested SDG 16 Survey questionnaire and the
  accompanying Implementation Manual, which countries can use for collecting
  data on 11 survey-based indicators under Goal 16 as well as two survey-based
  indicators under Goal 11.</p>

  <p>Another important regional standard is the Latin America and the Caribbean
  Crime Victimization Survey Initiative (LACSI), which countries can use to
  measure 4 survey-based indicators under Goal 16 including indicator 16.1.3, as
  well as the survey-based indicator in Goal 11. LACSI goes beyond measuring SDG
  2030 survey-based indicators and promotes the measurement of a wide range of
  dimensions to be measured in terms of safety and victimization that can be of
  use for policy makers and countries to better understand crime .<sup><a
  href="#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9">[8]</a></sup></p>

  <p><strong>Time series:</strong></p>

  <p>The indicator has recently been included into the annual United Nations
  Crime Trends Survey (UN-CTS, the regular data collection used by UNODC to
  collect data from UN Member States. It is expected that countries will
  gradually report on this indicator as the methodological guidance is
  disseminated and relevant items are included in national surveys.</p>

  <p><strong>Disaggregation:</strong></p>

  <p>Type of crime</p>

  <p>Sex and age</p>

  <p>Income level</p>

  <p>Educational attainment</p>

  <p>Victim-perpetrator relationship (current or former intimate partner, other
  family member, work colleague, school peer, other).</p>

  <p>When the proposed module on physical, psychological and sexual violence is
  part of a larger population survey, relevant disaggregations (e.g., sex, age,
  etc.) may not need to be included in the module since they are typically part
  of large socio-economic surveys. In contrast, disaggregations by type of crime
  and victim-perpetrator relationship need to be included in the question module
  itself.<sup><a href="#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10">[9]</a></sup></p><div

COMPARABILITY__GLOBAL: >-
  <p><strong>Sources of discrepancies:</strong></p>

  <p>Data for this indicator are based on a set of standardised survey
  questions. If data from more than one survey are available for the same
  country, discrepancies may be due to different wording of the questions,
  different structure of the questionnaire, different survey methods and
  operations, different sample design and sample size. As a rule, data from
  national surveys complying with recommended standards are used, when
  available.</p>
